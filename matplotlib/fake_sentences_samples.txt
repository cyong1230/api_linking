How do I add a title to my MatPlotLib basemap ?
It might help issue of things refusing to update , and at the least it will be faster .
For future use you should really find out why it is installed in a location that isn't searched by python by default .
I've done that and I'm still getting the same error - it can't find the sip module .
ImportError : DLL load failed : The specified module could not be found .
This has happened previously ( and I was not able to get around it ) .
@USER SObolev : Histograms of the values falling within a range of keys where each bin is of size 0.1
Also , now that I look at it , the y-axis limits haven't been set right .
I've looked for various solutions to my problem but can't get any help .
I normally use something akin to the following for this purpose and the result is a very nice plot where x1 , x2 and x3 are defined as follows
And I have all of them installed .
When I save these plots to pdf , it takes a long time to write , and reading the pdf is even worse .
Seems like a security setting on OS X is preventing it , and the quick fix seems to be to run apache as root .
Any ideas how to deal with this problem ?
If I remove the function and put its body back under the " if name == ' main '" block , it works as expected ( like in the original code ) .
Seems like a bit of searching would have turned up [ how to set custom ticks ] ( #URL ) , where the defined ` t11 ` is where you would write out A , B , C , and D .
@USER , that would require to have root access ( sudo ) which i dont have !
Any suggestions how this can work ?
Any help would be appreciated in understanding what I am missing .
How can I add the ` P_g ` values from each section to their respective column ?
Is there any other python package that would help ?
I'm having a problem , where I can't do a step graph of 2 lists I have , in which I need list ` x ` to be the x values , in which each ` x [ j ]` value will add with ` x [ j+1 ]` value for each step .
The best thing would we if one could integrate it into the label of the colorbar ( to say the color means A in units of B where B includes the order of magnitude ) .
ive tried to fix it with setting ax limits but that does not work .
@USER : I added some more info and also a code used .
If I wanted to make a combined image like the one shown below ( original source here ) ,
When you ** add ** two ** random variables** , the resulting density is the ** convolution ** of their ** densities** .
This made the program work just as in Windows , without any other modifications necessary .
Using PySide in place of PyQt4 results in the same behavior .
However , the first item appears to be a float #CODE
The code below loads the image data hosted on github and plots it : #CODE

I just completed a brute force test running through all permutations of [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] for the tmp_planes , a total of 720 different arrangements .
The way to fix it is using pip , as mentioned by @USER .
Do you mean a scatterplot of your dataset instead ?
Plotting subplots with secondary continuous y-axis across all subplots
However , I want to be able to call something or write some code which then skips any value in the array which would cause this error , then ignoring that row altogether .
Any help would be appreciated .
You are typing your code in at the bash ( terminal ) prompt , not the Python interpreter prompt .
Also , if you take a look at Rob's answer , its far simpler than the example shown on the website .
MPL is a big project with lots of moving parts , any help keep them up is appreciated .
I am less certain if I am solving the correct problem .
I am having a problem getting matplotlib to work well with interactive plotting ... what I see is that after displaying a few frames of my simulated data matplotlib hangs-and doesn't display any more .
If anyone has any idea , I appreciate the help .
You can populate a general 2d array by : Zhu shows in the answer below .
Have a look at this example : #CODE
That way , it is possible to see 2 dots on the same place .
This error shows up when the size of a and b ( taking from above example ) is not the same - so , 128 x-values here should be plotted against 128 y-values .

I'm trying to make an exponential fit to find the Lyapunov Exponent of this data , however , I keep getting this error : #CODE
So I wrote an argument ` origin= ' lower '` .

which you can run with this sample code : #CODE
Try converting your the pandas data series to lists or numpy array before plotting .
If I de-homogenize only the last column I can find the center of where the ellipse was projected , but I would like to see some shape information as well .
Ignoring a problem doesn't fix it .
Will add the code .
I found that in the folder C :\ Program Files\Python27\DLLs I cann't find the _socket file

Load the data sets individually , and then plot each one individually .
Have you looked at mplot3d on matplotlib ?
The columns are floats , I'm not using the index of integers .
Incidentally ( for someone reading this in the future as you know yours ) if you need to find your current Python version you can simply type ` python -V ` in the command line and it'll return the details , for example mine returns :

I produce a histogram where I put the weights in the parameter #CODE
Besides , I see that you use ` numpy ` in your code , so you can save and load file by ` numpy ` with a more compact codes like this without using the ` csv ` module .
Usually these sorts of simple array reshaping operations can be done in a couple of lines with Numpy , so I feel like I'm missing something .
I don't see any way I could do that .

From your piece of code it seems to me that ` clust_data ` is already a list of lists with the correct shape and that ` cellText ` after being filled is going to be the same of ` clust_data ` .
Anaconda doesn't by default load pylab into IPython so you can choose the backend after launching IPython .
Most likely I'll have graphs with longer labels and if I put them near lines , it'll look messy .
The lines are random within ranges that cause clustering of lines ; a behavior I wanted to verify .
have those lists all the same length aka would it be directly compatible witha 2d numpy array ?
Any assistance will be appreciated .
I have another working project where the toolbar is in the same panel as the canvas , and I think that might be the key difference between the two .

You need some criteria to select out the " best " in your context .
What do you mean when you say ` the first histogram will be the first column as the x values plotted against the second column as the y-values ` .
Unfortunately I don't have any experience doing this so won't be able to help .
A sample of my data to plot : #CODE
Also , I do not want user intermediation at all !
Rather than put together an example from scratch , there's an excellent example of this written by Paul Ivanov in the matplotlib examples ( It's only in the current git tip , as it was only committed a few months ago . It's not on the webpage yet . ) .
what to do next ?
I think you'll find you get better help if you describe * what * you're trying to do , rather than * how * you want to do it .
( ie save etc ) . ill have a look at the toolkits :D
in place of #CODE
You could cast the array to a list : #CODE
Add as many symlinks to the directory as you wish , it gives you fine-grained control over which packages you want to make accessible .
In the end , I found out that the problem was simply that matplotlib could not find any backend for plotting .
Please change your title to describe your _actual_ issue .
If you did not create one when you installed matplotlib , you can get this template from the matplotlib source , or from the matplotlib website .
I am sorry to be so needy , but I really cant find any useful information anywhere .
Or is there another way to change the size ?
I did find the way to make my images almost what I wanted with : #CODE
any idea ?
@USER : I suppose the specific way I have it set up would work better if you had , say , a 1000x1000 matrix , as it lets numpy pick how the tics should be spaced .
As you can see it only covers half of the matrix .
You iterate the items in ` glass ` , but then compare to the whole list instead of to the current ` item `

Regardless , once you get used to it , I find it much easier to write reusable plotting functions in python with matplotlib than in Matlab .
Now , you should be able to get all the libraries you need just as easily , using , too , Macports .

The background is that the array's values represent the water depth of a square grid .
And try debugging one step at a time : make sure you have good data before you try to plot it .
What do you mean the " label " ?
To do this we ll use the standard y=mx+b line equation where m is the line s slope and b is the line s y-intercept .
If you check the Matplotlib example for the function you are using , you will notice they use a similar methodology : build empty matrix and fill it with strings built with the interpolation method .
But the question still remains- how do I fix it ?

This is somewhat based on guesswork , since I can't test it with ` matplotlib ` , but something along these lines might work : #CODE
Here is some sample code resembling my case : #CODE
This is the result for printing every item in the xyz list and piping it into a file .
Or is your plot supposed to be an average or something ?
I just wasn't sure if changing some plotting functions around would help .
I agree with you , but I just tried to make code which uses as few less well-known features of ` matplotlib ` .

1 ) Let's assume I take 1 sample ` x = [ 1 , 2 ]` from the dataset
I have a 4d or higher ellipsoid in matrix form ( which form is important ) .
I didn't look into the documentation , simply used the dot completion on the handle
Here is your example with those modifications and also with a single layout computed at the beginning that is reused in the loop .
I now understand that I need to generate all the triplets across the three tables ( to cover all the combinations ) .
i dont know how array concatenation works on numpy arrays
I can't seem to get my head around why it doesn't show the value 128 as grey with I have chosen the cmap to be gray-scale .
what do you mean with %s ?
If that isn't what you want , I would recommend doing something where you create a PNG image of what you do want , create a child QLabel , and move the child widget around in your mouseMoveEvent .
Any suggestion is welcome .
I was trying to add a custom widget into qtdesginer using following code #CODE
source : #URL
As has been pointed out above , this will get more complicated if the both the y graphs were defined at different x points .
@USER Simoes , what happens is you have Nan's in various places in your array ?
An example script with generated data rather than the real data is : #CODE
Also , it's harder to reproduce across multiple machines ( even if that just means " my current machine , and the new laptop I'll have 18 months from now when I've forgotten how to solve it ") .
The words ' non-default ' and ' normal ' are mine - I'm not sure what they mean yet .
( think of it as a unit square )
This code uses a Counter to count the number of instances that an object occurs in an array ( in this case counting the number of times an integer is in your list ) .
In the image above I'm trying to extract iso-value 25 from the scalar field of f ( x , y )= x^3+y^3 .
Is there any other way I can plot my result continuously ?
at lag 0 , the ACF is 0.5 .
The example talks about a fit to power law , but clearly a straight line could be done as well .
As I see it , I could resolve and make it work if I could adjust the line spacing / height to be less than what the font requests .
tells the writer to temporarily save the frames to disc before composing the movie , which side-steps the problem .
Select starting color in matplotlib colormap
I know this question is a couple years old , but since there is no accepted answer , I'll add what works for me .
include the piece of the code where you make call to ` mpl_connect `
Is there any ready to use function based on python's matplolib ?
-2 is high of indices range and then low of indices range
Any insight you could provide that would help get me started the proper way would be fantastic .
( I can open a new question if that's perferable )
For example , here's a simple bit of code that sets up a list of colors based on whether the data is positive or negative : #CODE
With that example data I was getting " shape mismatch " errors .
Then , I'd use POV-Ray or Blender to model the planes at whatever angles , spheres for the round things ( planets ? ) .
So , thus far , all I produce is :
I'm hoping I can find a funciton ( or build one ) that does new_ids_arr = new_ids * new_ids^Transpose ... or similar
Any help much appreciated .
But there are still white edges around ( I have added a screenshot to my original question )
How could I use ` matplotlib ` to represent such a matrix as a grid of red and black squares ?
The thick grey line in the middle of the violin is the bootstrapped 99% confidence interval of the mean , which is the white horizontal line , both from pointplot .
@USER I up voted you but add ` import numpy as np `
So , when you reduce to 2 dimensions , the power is the sum of the first 2 eigen values .
Indexing starts with ` 0 ` in Python ( and most any other programming language I know ) .
I have a matrix file of Hurricane data and it plots with the command : #CODE
If they enter 30 , they will look at a 30-minute time window , if they type 5 , matplotlib picks this up , data gets trimmed , and only 5 minutes worth of data gets shown .
In the meanwhile does any one has a better suggestion ?
I want it at y= 10.5 , specifically .
I then plot each of these values , but to get a more sensible result , I need to take the mean of all of these files for each cell , and plot that with the standard deviation obtained as error bars .
I'm using data of the form : ` [ num1 , num2 ,..., numk ]` ( an array of integers ) .
For the time steps where convergence is reached Id like to have the x-axis green and for non-convergence starting from light red for not so bad to red for bad .
For instance you can add #CODE
I don't want to get a newer one just incase any of the practice problems / lecture problems are incompatible with a newer version of IDLE .
All of these frames are loaded at the start of the application .
if you suspect one specific builtin , try checking it's type ( ` type ( dict )`) , or look at the properties / functions it has ( ` dir ( dict )`) .
In some work I have done we used a simple approximation of the derivative , when this changes sign you have a peak ( in 1D data ) , one can then add some parameters to remove peaks due to noise .
Here's a working code sample that shows you how to get it working .
How can I change this behavior and use Arial fonts for all of my plots ?
How to divide ytics to a certain number in matplotlib ?
Matplotlib cannot find facefile , is using old Python interpreter location
do you get any message when trying plotting it ?
I have mac os x 10.5.8 and was wondering if anyone could recommend where I could find the proper package .
Well , this isn't a wxPython answer but I've used Chaco for this sort of thing and it's pretty straight forward .
The point IS at its position namely ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) .
All is fine again .
The next plot to show has the same clusters and colors but a different location .
@USER The first approach would help only if the internal representation was the problem , but it doesn't solve the underlying size issue .
After hours analyzing the source code of basemap's ` tissot ` function , learning some properties of ellipses and lot's of debugging , I came with a solution to my problem .
You'd need to refactor the code to break your worker method up into smaller pieces that multiple processes can work on at the same time , and then pull it back together once all the pieces are ready .
are you just trying to open a separate window or display that window inside of your main window ?
The one catch : if you embed a PDF inside a textbox , Word will rasterize this when you save it to a PDF .
How can I address a specific line ( by name , by number , by reference ) throughout the program and delete that line ?
And also I need to do that for all variables simultaneously .
` newtitle = " %s\n$%s$ " % ( ' text\ below\ the\ main\ title ' , newtitle )`
Have you had a look at the ` webagg ` matplotlib backend ?
find the file from the link
If you want separate figures , as the title of your question suggests the ` subplots=True ` argument might get the job done .
I suggest removing all the domain specific stuff .
Just change ` shape ` to ` ( 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 )` and see .
Any help would be appreciated .
However , ( at least what I have seen is that ) sometimes after the plot has been displayed , it goes into a " Not Responding " mode and you just have to kill the process anyways .
It consists in a floating-point parameter P , with dimension NxM , and each pixel is geolocated by the fields latitude and longitude ( each of size NxM ) .
In order to change the order of the bars , you should change the order in the index .
This does not work when I replace the random plot data with an actual color PNG image .
For example , say you had data between 0 and 1 but didn't like the colors used at the extremes of the colormap for 0 and 1 .
After searching through multiple posts , I basically want to use a generic colormap ( rainbow ) and multiply my third array by the colormap in order to display different colors for each of the xy points .
Hi , Thanks Tobold , I will check the source code you mention .
This next block is what does what you want with the ` for ` loop .
Say that I have 6 variables that I want to sort into these 3 groups and plot like a venn diagram .
ValueError : setting an array element with a sequence .
My need is that I want to plot these nominal values of both actual and predicted ones on the same plot so that It will be easy to compare how good was the prediction as compared to actual values .
So , open up your favorite Terminal emulator and enter #CODE
Also , the lists need to be equal length .
Because matplotlib will convert things to numpy arrays regardless , there are more efficient ways to do it .
And here is where I grab the data and I try to update the limits of the plot #CODE
Any help is appreciated .
Which is the why , conveniently , ` colors ` keyword exists .
How can I find the code to support multiple plotting scales and X-axis on seperate panels using sizer routines ?
I'm trying to build Matplotlib from source with Tkinter .
This means that you can install matplotlib locally in your ` virtualenv ` and it will find all of its backend dependencies in the system-wide ` site-packages ` .
I am trying to create a simple GUI using tkinter which will just open a window displaying the plot .
Web convinces me using this is no good idea after all : For example #URL " Avoid 3-D charts at all costs .
Using pure Python , you can extract columns ` 1 ` , ` 5 ` and ` 7 ` by using the following nested list comprehension : #CODE
Is there any way of getting some input from a user in matplotlib ?
` theta ` is in radians instead of degrees .
' plot ' shows me a line interconnecting all data points , but not the data points themselves ( unless there's a way I don't know of ) .
I could divide the ` peak_top ` by 2 to find the half height and then try and find y-values corresponding to the half height , but then I would run into trouble if there are no x-values exactly matching the half height .
why can't it find the file ?
However , the resulting image always has the same resolution , around ( 250x250 ) .
Installing those packages from the source can be a pain , especially on Windows and OS X .
Sort arrays by two criteria
However , I am kinda confused , any help would be appreciated .
Unfortunately if you search this array for all subnodes given some index you only get some of the subnodes contained by the original triangle because most nodes belong to several triangles and they are only added to one of these .
If I set shrink 1.0 and fraction to anything , it shrinks the graph , not affecting the colorbar size at all , until changing fraction causes it to be exactly what I already have , at which point changing them stops doing anything .
It doesn't add anything else .
Now I just wish they'd add some kind of drop down menu to matplotlib ...
Thanks for any help
The source data's list is called xyz .
I have been looking around and maybe it could be a version-of-Pyhton problem .
( I want to reduce the size of the outlier ) #CODE
This should work for any number of columns and length of data .
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated , this has been doing my head in .
where axes_square is simply : #CODE
I can put together a more detailed answer based on that package if desired .
It's fairly easy to speed it up by making an approximation -- just take the 2D histogram and blur it with a guassian filter of the right radius and covariance .
I've tried the solutions posted by Marek and qarma attempting to obtain the coordinates of the bins rather than the index of them , like so : #CODE
What do you mean by make sure the ' backend setting for pylab is not set to inline ?
sets the initial x , v of every particle in an array
Post more information on structure of your array .
Here is a sample code if anyone wants to play with it .
Are all these settings really necessary to achieve the result I'm looking for , or is there perhaps a more compact way to accomplish my goal : #CODE
I want to select ( in the SQL sense ) just columns ` b0 ` through ` b9 ` from the array , giving the structure #CODE
I can't find any method to tell mpl to plot all of the data , it seems that there are only methods for drawing every n'th element or similar ( and passing 1 does not help ) .
