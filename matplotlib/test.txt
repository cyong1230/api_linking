AMAZINGLY , it does not show the legend text sticking to the roof :/ .
Basically , you want to pass ` patch_artist=True ` to ` boxplot ` .
The append data is not the nicest way to get all the X and Y data in lists .
My question is specifically about the colorbar , not about the axes itself .
I am using an animation to save this process graphically .
Also , all axes objects ( the objects that have plotting methods ) , have a parent figure object anyway , thus : #CODE
I have a plot consisting of a blue surface ( plotted via ` plot_surface `) and a red sphere ( plotted via ` scatter `) .
matplotlib's scatter plot changes the axis of another plot
I have the strange effect , that the color of the outlier changes , if i change the symbol used to draw them .

Matplotlib animation slows down when adding patches
It isn't quite perfect though , the colors are ever-so-slightly off from the colors from contourf .
Matplotlib Axis Control
how can this be fixed ? to summarize , I'm trying to plot something very simple : a square dendrogram in the top subplot , and a square heatmap in the bottom subplot , with the color bar on the right . nothing fancy .
To get an idea what a subplot should look like , this is the product in excel :
Is there any way to move extreme y-labels of each subplot a little bit downwards or upwards ( as I did manually in mspaint , on the right ) ?
Using a threshold would select the data within all those contour lines .
python : scatter plot logarithmic scale
I guess otherwise one would have to alter the handles before passing them to the legend which does not seem easier than consecutively calling errobar / plot .
where is the ` legend ` here ?

You append the content of ` col ` list , which is text .
Have a look at this question : [ Custom Legend in Matplotlib ] ( #URL )
You should use this only when you are playing around in an interactive terminal ( other than ` plt.subplots ` or ` plt.figure ` for setting up the figure / axes objects ) .
This one disables all the axes stuff : #CODE
My issue was that I did not know , how to access each subplot data .
Here instead of the 5 plots drawn in the last column , I want several inset axes containing a plot .
Since I have the legend outside the plot frame , I would like to remove only the top and bottom white space .
However this winds me up with blank axes .
Are there any colormaps or is there a simple way to transform a matplotlib colormap to provide a much bigger color range near 0.5 and a smaller one at the extremes ?
56 after ( artist , renderer )
I posted earlier about a program I was attempting to make to plot four-dimensional data ( xyz coords and voltages ) on a 3d scatter plot with a colour map dependent upon the magnitude of the voltages .
First define a mappable such as an image ( with imshow ) or a contour set ( with contourf ) .
The function for horizontal stem lines is ` hlines() ` ( ` vlines() ` is for vertical stem bars ): #CODE
I just run the first code example in your solution , it doesn't show any animation or dynamically updating plot , I mean the plot just showed up after firing the code , why ?
Then go ahead and create your axes and plots !
The figure should have a subplot layout of two by two , where the first plot should occupy the first two subplot cells ( i.e. the whole first row of plot cells ) and the other plots should be positioned underneath the first one in cells 3 and 4 .
I saw this image online and was wondering how to go about these types of animation .
In any case , I'm dubious about the way you're doing animation .
I would like to draw a plot with a logarithmic y axis and a linear x axis on a square plot area in matplotlib .
My matplotlib.pyplot legend is being cut off

Making the assumption that you are using legend ...
Your ` subplots_adjust ` hides the axes which might not be what is needed .
Lets say i want to " zoom in " by limiting the x scale with setting xlim =( 1 , 2 ) .
I have 2 points ( a vector of size 8 ) and 3 different bitwise operation ( And , Or , Xor ) I mapped each point and the result of bitwise operations on the 2D plot . now I want to show each points real data itself and the result of operation beside plot ( righ of the plot or above the plot ( whenever is possible or it's better )) so later when I want to analysis the result I can read data value easily . right now my image is like this , and you can see the legend is cut off and I have no place outside of plot to write anything :
How to reduce xticks label resolution when showing clock time
You can probably set the ` ylim ` .
this option is helpful but does not answer the question so i downvoted . as far as i can tell , best never puts the legend outside of the plot
As it happens , I have a lot of data in the plot and when I am using ` pylab.show() ` , I have to maximize the window before I can see all of the plot correctly , and the xlabel tickers don't superimpose on each other .
This is a nice tutorial on colormaps .
The remaining question is how to plot the graph and refresh it according to ` n ` parameter value ?
Is there a way to either ( a ) add space between the last scatter point and the spine using an existing command or ( b ) use the approach I attempted and hide or make the last label match the background color , or ( c ) since I'm new to matplotlib and I'm not familiar with all of the terminology , direct me to an existing link ?
In case you want more control , set the ` colors ` keyword in ` contourf ` to a tuple of matplotlib colors , with the same number of elements as you have levels ( minus 1 : the colors correspond to the intervals between your level boundaries ) .
I want to change my plot size smaller ( 3 , 2 ) but I have an issue that my text ( axis label , legend , axis title ) don't change their sizes .

Using pylab , I want to plot just the data with no axes or borders to a png file .
I have managed to create the following subplot which needs to have the bar chart on the left , and the matrix / color mesh on the right : #CODE
I ended up with a scatter plot in each of the two subplots , but now all the prettiness from prettyplotlib is gone .
This will be very slow as you are setting up a ` scatter ` object every time .
The ` matplotlib ` ` scatter ` and ` plot ` functions split out their arguments , so it's agnostic to the shape of the array , but ` ax.plot3d ( particles [ 0 ] , particles [ 1 ] , particles [ 2 ])` is shorter to type than the version with ` particles [ ..., 0 ]`
I'm taking a data from files and want to make an animation of four plots at the same time : two colourbars and two lines .
Or you can assign the axes to variables so you dont have to do everything in order , #CODE
You need to call ` legend ` for the legend to appear .
But I also guess that there are some colormaps that suit this task really well .
As a side note , if you only have one axes in the figure , you can just use the axes title .
To get the axes currently used by matplotlib use ` plt.gca() .get_ylim() `
but this also results in the legend being at the right :
@USER Asahi hacked a solution by violating the rules for ' axes fraction ' textcoords , but as mentioned , it is not the expected behavior .

How to make offset axes in matplotlib ?
I'm not sure what you mean by " make the y-axis and x-axis non transparent " ; the line ` ax.collections [ 0 ] .set_alpha ( 0 )` is making the lowest contour transparent ; if you don't want that , don't include that line .

` subplot ` works as follows , if for example I had a subplot values of ` 3 , 1 , 1 ` .
Use the label argument in combination with legend : #CODE
First : there is some white space between the axes and the image , I don't really know why they appear .
I'd go with using ` annotate ` rather than try to futz with ` legend ` , it provides a great deal of control over placement and properties .
It turns out that some xticks are hidden automatically : there should be 18 xticks , but only 9 of them are shown ( seems to be hidden automatically ) .
I could not figure out a way to remove a point from scatter plot after plotting , though if i use the same method i can plot a new point .
This is where I'm standing now but want the legend in the bottom right corner regardless of where the last subplot is .

matplotlib - extracting values from contour lines
` scatter ` takes an argument ` color ` which allows you to set the point color ( hard to guess ) .
The little catch is that the unit is in axes unit , referred to the size of you plot , so a margin of 1 will put space around your plot at both sizes big as your present plot

So instead I append data to the plot using ` myPlot ` but when I try to append data points to the twinx() subplot using a different style ( blue diamonds for example , the values don't show up .
Is there a way to have the xticks have the values 2012 , 2014 etc ..
In my experience , you have to set your axis limits after plotting the data , otherwise it will look at your data and adjust whatever axes settings you entered before to fit it all in-frame out to the next convenient increment along the axes in question .
You can change the axes position using the set_position function : #CODE
I.e. , each contour line at some level would have a color associated with it representing how many times it has happening in N realizations .
The scatter plot isn't a great option as the data really do form little boxes of known size and scatters make that hard to replicate .
If I comment the ax2.add line out , it shows the collection only in the first subplot .
There's only 5 , so a custom legend is what I was thinking .

I am trying to annotate a scatter plot in Python 2.7 , with Matplotlib .
It's the ` imshow ` command that's changing the aspect ratio of the axes , not the colorbar .
@USER - It's not working because the way the axes stack for a figure works has been changed in newer versions of matplotlib .
Basically , instead of having one marker or the other ( or both separately ) on the legend , I'm looking to have one legend entry with the marker being the circle with a ' dot ' in the middle ( the same as how it's displayed on the plot ) .
We first draw the line and then add the markers as a scatterplot on top of it : #CODE
I can draw the vertices using ` path ` s as well ( for example , using circle paths with the right style , placed at the right location .
Do you mean remove the grid / axes / axis labels etc ?
If I let it print t after every animation i corectly adds one up in console , but the text does not get updated in the plot .
Some parameters could easily be read from the ` Legend ` object , others ( like ` title ` , ` fancybox `) required some ' artistics ' .

You ask matplotlib to create figure and axes object , and then you do all the rest by calling methods of those objects : #CODE
I now want to just have one shared , centralised Y Axis label but I'm not sure how to do this .
@USER In this case , if your 4 subplots have the same horizontal dimension , I would define the yaxis location manually in coordinate relative to the axes instead , like shown here : #URL It requires to adjust manually the x-position though .
The approach of just passing around a figure or axes instance ( or list of instances ) is much simpler for complex cases , in my experience ...
I have a figure showing the contourf plot and another showing a plot i've made earlier and I want to plot both on the same figure what should I do ?
Fix #1 : draw points instead of lines ( ` plot ( t , f1 , ' o ')`) , then you'll at least see all your data .
Instead of one pixel , we then draw a bar in the plot .

On looking at this more , it looks like you are doing all of your plotting on the hartee / bohr axes and the using ` twinx ` and ` twiny ` to get the eV and angstrom axes , but never plot anything to them .
How can I make the remaining subplot blank ?
` sankey.add() ` supports a ` transform ` keyword argument .
Also , note the ` set_position ([ left , bottom , width , height ])` command can be used to change the size of the axes , which will bring the title closer to the table .
You can even do ` ax = event.artist.axes ; ax.lines.index ( event.artist )` if you need to work with multiple axes or don't want to deal with passing the axes object around .

For the next release , I would like to have 3d axes to take up more than the default axes spacing , since the default was designed to take into account that tick labels and axes labels would be outside the axes , which is not the case for mplot3d .
@USER -I just realized how surprising is the amount of details that I need to modify in order to implement the same functionality with the ` scatter ` command .
To illustrate , the following code would generate a grouped boxplot #CODE

Why do you expect that using a 4th axes object ( a heavy object that needs to be fully rendered ) would be faster than updating three lines ( which are lightweight objects and it can be optimized greatly via ` blit `) ?
You can annotate a specific point in the image using ` plt.text ( x , y , str )` .
This is one of the many reasons why you'll often see people recommend avoiding the ` pyplot ` interface and using Axes / Figure methods instead .
Adding axes manually is an advanced thing that you would do if you need precise placement of axes ; in most cases , however , you should just let Matplotlib do its thing , and use ` plt.tight_layout() ` when things go wrong .

The ` transform ` in this case is a ` BboxTransformTo ` object , which :
A simple way to do this would be to create an empty list before the loop , and each time you generate a number , just ` append ` it to the list instead of printing it .
My solution is a more manual way of getting at the same piece of information using the same underlying concept : setting up the implicit equation as f ( x , y ) such that f ( x , y ) = 0 is equivalent to the original implicit equation and isolating its zero contour .

You can just plot with pandas , access the matplotlib ` Axes ` object by using ` ax = df.plot() ` and then customize it further from there .
Say I have a marker with a known size in points and I want to draw an arrow to this point .
The plot generates , however , the xlabel and ylabel won't show up for some reason .
If you end up plotting points instead of lines like Joe suggests , you may be able to get away with adding new , finer-sampled collections over the old ( same color of course ) .
I'm guessing that somehow the slider is getting locked to my maximum number of x values , but I don't see how .
Moreover , when I pick a point in the first subplot , the color of the corresponding point in the second subplot changes but not vice versa .

I'm trying to draw a scatter plot with a fitted dotted line .
As you can see , this is a boxplot on which are superimposed a scatter of black points : x indexes the black points ( in a random order ) , y is the variable of interest .
However , in my real application - which uses the exact same commands for subplots , contourf and colorbar , only that these are dispersed across several routines - the labels on the colorbars are not showing up ( the color patches seem to be ok though ) .
It's not overwritten , the axes limits are just reset to the extents of the last image each time .
In this second option , you can still use ` plt.xlabel() ` and ` plt.ylabel() ` to add labels to the axes .
This means that if you would simply set ` xlim ( -1 , 1 )` and ` ylim ( -1 , 1 )` for all the subplots , you would get diagrams that all have the same total area ( assuming all subplots are shown at the same scale ) .
The canvas seems to get locked and after the call of the pick event I can not use the other functionalities as well .

` scatter ` returns a collection that is much harder to manage .
This ratio will of course vary depending on figure / axes size .
Consider your arrays are named ` mag ` , ` x ` , and ` y ` , then ` allthem = dstack (( x.ravel() , y.ravel() , mag.ravel() ))` and ` scatter ( x=allthem [ ..., 0 ] , y=allthem [ ..., 1 ] , c=allthem [ ..., 2 ])` .

Autoscale a matplotlib Axes to make room for legend
You want a legend that is part 2 columns , part 1 column ?
I found the ` set_title ` in the ` axes ` -documentation ( which isn't the same as an ` axis ` , confusing for non-native-english readers ) .
Draw an arrow on scatterplot subplot
The following code gives me a plot with significant margins above and below the figure .
The marker size in ` scatter ` is given as area .
I have found that there is a keyword argument for the animation function , ` repeat ` , that can be set to ` False ` , but this has no apparent effect on my code !
You need to append your ` end_date ` to ` x1 ` after you plot the actual data , then remake ` x2 ` with the new appended value , before you plot the trendline .
how can I plot on the axes
The contour is just to show how the function behaves around 0 .
Thank you very much but i need to add continues vertical line from 0 to 10 of " y " axes , if i will use your methon i will have this : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , but i nedd this _____________ ( but vertical ) .
Below code plot the scatter plot with differnt markers for each year and different color for each month .
but I would like the ticks to be at the zero axes ( as in a normal graph ... ) .
I want a pdf ( preferably ) image inside a subplot in matplotlib to show the plots at different stages of the cycle .
Thanks Joop , unfortunately the title command just changes the part that says ` Age ` in the boxplot ( in your post ) , that's why I asked .
My doubt is can i be able to draw a histogram using 2 lists ?
Note that all contours connect the two poles , but even though I have NOT plotted the 0 degree contour , all the other contours follow along the 0 degree discontinuity ( because pyplot thinks if it's 0 on one side and 360 on the other , there must be all other angles in between ) .
In fact , I am writing a code where the appearance of the scatter point is bound with a Tkinter Checkbutton and I want it to appear / disappear when I click / unclick the button .
You can sort out what the correct figure coordinates would be to be at a given place in data-space , but it will not update if you pan / zoom .
Both of these cases are not ideal in my case as I would like to achieve reasonably high refresh rates .
Draw and refresh two independent windows with pyplot
I am trying to plot a scatter plot using certain colours for certain data points .
This is the right idea , except generally the figure contains one or more axes and most of the action is in calling the axes methods to make your plots , so it's easier to make the figure , then the axes , and pass the axes ( or some object within them ) to the functions .
Ok last question , how can I color with this results a a scatter point , tried to convert it to hex but it did not work
Thanks - I had expected it to be somewhat similar to matlab where image() returns the axes handle .
Just needs to be edited to have your ` xticks = [ ]` named something else e.g. ` xtks = [ ]` and instead of ` xticks ( xtks )` need to use ` set_xticklabels ( xtks )`
You can do this quite simply on a per axis basis by simply re-assigning ` format_coord ` of the ` Axes ` object , as shown in the examples .
None | parent axes object from which space for a new
I want to fix the color range on multiple scatter plots and add in a colorbar to each plot ( which will be the same in each figure ) .
So that if I have 10 subplots in a 3x4 grid the legend will be under the last subplot which will be the in the 2nd place of the bottom row , but if I have 19 subplots in a 4x5 grid the legend will be under the subplot which will be in the 4th place of the bottom row .
I am trying to create a scatter plot with the color for each point based on the value in y-dimension and the tooltip for each point based on the value of x-axis .
And since you want a legend , it seems plausible that you have a small number of lines .
As a follow-up to my previous question , I was wondering what is the proper way of creating multiple polar ` contourf ` subplots and add a single color bar to them .
Actually the following workaround works well , returning a ` dict ` from the boxplot command : #CODE
My axes are improperly sized and my xlims and ylims are not taken into account -- I've updated my question with example code and a new figure .
To fix this , let's make the histogram using ` np.histogram2d ` ( what ` plt.hist2d ` uses behind-the-scenes ) , and then plot it using ` pcolormesh ` ( or ` pcolor `) , which does support log axes : #CODE
Also , if you change the animation to update an existing object instead of adding a new one on top of the old , you'll have much better performance ( your current approach may become slower with each frame ) .
There's one additional trick : We need to have a special ` save ` method , as all of the others draw the canvas before saving , which will wipe out everything we've drawn on it previously .
Even if you fixed this exact issue ( maybe by using a different backend , or stripping off the offending function ( which might break things in other ways )) I am pretty sure there are core parts of ` Figure ` , ` Axes ` , or ` Canvas ` objects that can not be pickled .
mp.rcParams [ ' xtick.major.width '] : the linewidth of large xticks ( yticks similar )
I use matplotlib to display a matrix of numbers as an image , attach labels along the axes , and save the plot to a PNG file .
Say I have a marker with a known size in points and I want to draw an arrow to this point .
Here is my code to draw the line : #CODE
The matplotlib contour plots have this type of labeling functionality ( though the lines are labeled in the case of the contour plot ) .
I want to transform the data in order to plot them in matplotlib as a rectangle .
My main problem is that all of the examples I've come across online use subplot function to assign the location of the graph ( which I understand ) but then plot the graphs as a function of X and Y - as follows : #CODE
If you put in an image as an annotation , zooming in on the axes will not scale the image .
I'd find it very useful if there was a generic way to obtain the bounding boxes in data coordinates for any arbitrary matplotlib artist .
Based on a reading of the Matplotlib Artists tutorial , it seems like ` pyplot ` takes care of a few behind-the-scenes setup tasks , most notably establishing the connection between the Figure object and the desired renderer / backend .
The code I use to draw the graph for each different graph is identical apart from the data being drawn , is that the issue ?
#URL I am referring to the scatter plot section .
Basically , what's happening is that there's a third axes object created that you're not currently retaining a reference to .
[ scatter ] ( #URL ) will set the color of markers based on the value of a separate array .
Plotting 3-tuple data points in a surface / contour plot using matplotlib
A ` contour ` -based solution would be fine as well .
When the legend is created it accepts a number of keyword arguments :
how much stuff do you have plotted on your axes when you clear it ?
then the dots have acceptable sizes ( although a bit fake ) but the colorbar legend starts at 1 and ends at 11 , which I don't want .
Notice that all 3 plots will stay in-sync as you zoom , pan , etc .
This is just a example that shows how to change label spacing . you should set legend location and font size by other parameters of legend() .
the result is the same : plot area is not increased and legend gets shifted off the plot .
a quick look at artist demo #CODE
I dont want to use subplots and also i dont want to add axvline for each axes .
All right , with that working , I'd like to compile everything to a single exe , but using ' bundle_files ' : 1 and zipfile = None still elaves the mpl-data folder in the dist folder .
Once this is done , it is just the matter of putting labels on the axes .
The command I use seems to apply the xlim only to the last of the facets .
The transform for each tick is set for data units for x ( because it's an xaxis ) and axis units for y ( 0 to 1 ) , but displaced by a fixed padding ( in pixels ) from the x axis .
what I also want to move the ylabel on the right ?
The force update is working by keeping the colors but only on the last scatter plot drawn .
And wish to overlay those signals in the same subplot .
The second subplot is just the first image with an overlay ploted .
For the following code setting the axes limit does not work and I have no idea why .
remove overlapping tick marks on subplot in matplotlib
I saw this : Animating matplotlib axes / ticks and
A considerable amount of code that does various parts of plotting things is omitted , but here is the generation of the figure and axes itself : #CODE
In my display function I format the axis of the subplot like so : #CODE
If I understand correctly , you seem to be looking for ` subplot ` s .

How to scatter ( draw ) on basemap in an streaming manner in Ipython Notepbook ?
Plotting_context decorator should give a large text in the legend .
In the documentation for Axis it mentions a ` get_label ` method which returns a Text instance .
I am trying to animate a complex figure with several subplots and have started testing with the artist animation and the function animation methods .
Do I have to resort to doing something like plotting my own rectangular patches ?
In your example you create a figure and axes on-the-fly and keep plotting in that same axes .
I'm not an expert with animation method .
When you plot using axes , you generate an Artist object , but when you plot using plt , you generate a list of Artist objects .
Turns out , you need to do ` ax.add_artist ( Rectangle )` to have the color specifications work ; when using ` patches.append ( Rectangle )` , the rectangle is shown in blue ( on my PC , at least ) ignoring any color specification .
Figure Not Responding after returning to console from show() ?
I have a polynomial equation expressed as a poly1d object and want to take it and use it to label the scatter plot I'm making .
You need to find out exactly what you are calling from Sublime Text .

Say I set things up with ` axes [ 0 ]` for the visualization and ` axes [ 1 ]` as the place where I want the table .
Now ` errorbar_colors ` will be a ` (8 , 4 )` array of RGBA values from the ` winter ` colormap : #CODE
I plotting both the curves then I would like to draw a line parallel to y axis passing through the intersection point and find the x value
You may need a ` plt.pause ( 0.01 )` after the ` plt.draw() ` line to get the refresh to show .
I'm pretty sure that there is many ways of plotting this kind of animation without global variables .
I saw this image online and was wondering how to go about these types of animation .
You can plot your infinity data point in its own subplot by substituting a sufficiently large number ( to make the curve look right ) .
For example , ` scatter ` returns a ` Collection ` , so you need to call ` set_offsets ` instead of ` set_xy ` to change the x , y data .
The handles used in the call to legend don't have to be on the ` axes ` that you calling ` legend ` on .
First boxplot missing or not visible
It is for this reason that the axes does not fill the space allocated to it on the figure .
There was a question on the matplotlib mailing list , and the answer was that it is not possible with the current ( 2009 ) implementation of the legend ( #URL ) .

I am trying to create an iphone app in Xcode that takes data ( some matrix ) and creates a contour plot in uiimageview .
The matplotlib contour plots have this type of labeling functionality ( though the lines are labeled in the case of the contour plot ) .
I'm trying to find ( but not draw ! ) contour lines for some data : #CODE
It might be something you configure in your ` Figure ` subclass via ` add_axes ` .
How can matplotlib 2D patches be transformed to 3D with arbitrary normals ?
The problem is that the coloring of the second y-axis via ` yticks ` is not working anymore .
@USER - Alternately you could call ` ax.axis ( ' tight ')` to automatically set the axes limits to the bounds of the data , rather than manually specifying them .
I want to make a contour plot of some data , but it is possible that all values in the field at the same value .
I'm using 1.3.1 and when I ` set_zlim ` or ` set_zlim3d ` it just limits the axes but doesn't actually clip the data .
I'm using FuncAnimation in matplotlib's animation module for some basic animation .
Or is there a better way to create a contour plot in objective-c ?
I don't know how to do this latter ( draw the lines with blur ) with Matplotlib .
I tried a method using xticks , and it plotted my y values , but that was it .
Unicode string in Matplotlib annotate
I'm experimenting with ` matplotlib ` to draw figures in figures in figures .
You could also use text instead of legend since you don't need the text associated with markers .
And can you put in a PR to change the official example to use the ` Formatter ` class ?
@USER - ` tight_layout ` changes the size of the axes .
I could solve this manually setting the legend ( which I don't know if it's the best approach ): #CODE
Then I use a for loop to plot the primary y-axis scatter plot - I have to use a loop in order to iterate through the columns of a Pandas dataframe which are the x and y-variables .
In principle , you can change " ncol " within a legend by manually rearranging these offsetboxes .
One way to do it is using spines : #CODE
It worked for the first animation , but as soon as the configuration changed , I had artifacts from previous animations all over the new ones
It has multiple colors for a given legend item .
Otherwise I think factorplot doesn't operate on axes ( unlike distplot ) .
The default behavior is to not draw anything on those pixels .
I you want some kind of animation ( I don't how you're going to use the rotating image , so I can only speculate ) , maybe you're better off using some kind of game / graphics library , e.g. Pygame .
How to show ? in the legend of matplotlib , python ?
gca() means Get Current Axis
The ' this ' I meant was the arguments on ` margins ` .
In a nutshell , you want ` self.figure = Figure ( figsize =( 400 / 80.0 , 300 / 80.0 ))` .
First of all , you say you want to make a surface plot , but in your code you make a scatter plot .
You can also directly monkey-patch this in to ` Axes ` as-is .
Here's the code I'm using to draw the lines : #CODE
I want the contour lines to be on the edges of those rectangles .
However , let's try making the plot a different way first ( after which we'll wind up coming back to ` annotate ` anyway ) .
below is basic code and image for four subplots , I cant figure out how to reduce the size of the sci power notation above the y axis .
I iterate over the axes to plot for Cabbage , Green beans , Potato and Wheat .
If you want to use ` scatter ` try something like #CODE
I am no longer receiving that error , however no graph is displayed following the animation .
Since I need to draw several axvspan in the same plot , and I would like to know if there is a way to delete all at once ?
In this case , they are set to ` 1e-300 ` and are not consulted when determining the ylim of the plot .
Hi I have a data set for which I am using hist available in matplotlib.pyplot : #CODE
My initial thought was to run a for loop for time ( t ) calculating h at all points ( this is what I would do in MATLAB ) , however looking at the examples in the Matplotlib documentation I am not sure whether carrying out an animation this way is possible .
Another option is to provide an axes object using the ` ax ` argument : #CODE
` subplots ` returns an ndarray of axes objects , you can just flatten or ravel it : #CODE
I have a scatter plot : #CODE
I'm having a similar issue with Gtk and patches .
I have gotten a scatter plot working .
This code is " zoom-safe " ( i.e. the altitude and pressure labels change nicely when you zoom into the plot or pan it , and the model levels change consistently ) .
I am trying to use the animation features ( specifically FuncAnimation ) in 1.2 .
If ax is the current axes in pyplot , then the kwarg ` ax=ax ` is not needed .
I suspect this is a general matplotlib question ( e.g. , how to get to line color from a Figure ) , but I can't find the answer anywhere .
How to disable auto-swapping in axes labels in matplotlib ?
Instead you need to plot the boxplot on the axes in the subplot .
As of matplotlib ` v1.4.0rc4 ` , a ` remove ` method has been added to the legend object .
EDIT : minimal hist example #CODE
Where is ` Figure ` from ?
I would like to have the patches with a slight transparency so that the points and edges behind the patches can be seen .
Everything works fine until I have many arrows to draw .
A much improved subplot interface has been added to matplotlib since this question was first asked .
You can't pass xlabel , ylabel and title as arguments to the ` plot() ` method , as those are properties of ` Axes ` instances .
This ( along with proper titles and captions ) will draw attention to the smoothing so that there's no risk of anyone misunderstanding the fact that the smoothed plot is altered data , and lets you display the prettier large contours with another panel for the uglier , jagged small contours .
` set_title() ` should work on an axes instance .
IDL's contour plot does this ( filling in the wedge between 2* pi-epsilon and epsilon ) , with the very same dataset .
The problem is the ` plt.ylim ` line which applies to only the current axes , hence they are not lined up because you instructed the library to have them not lined up .
This looks like it is an issue with how the buttons are made ( drawn as circles ) and the aspect ratio of the axes .
Hm this is why I tend to write the whole plotting procedure inside a single ` for ` loop , so that you're making a new subplot and immediately changing its settings .
` .legend ` takes a parameter ` numpoints ` which sets number of point to show , so you can set it to 1 by adding ` numpoints=1 ` to ` legend ` call .
Wrong value in matplotlib yticks
The ` ondraw ` event handler gets the current x limits of the current axes ` gca() ` , selects ` y ` values with corresponding ` x ` coordinates within the x limits and sets new y limits determined by the minimum and maximum y value of selected coordinates .
I somehow expected that tool which offers contour plot should offer smoothing too .
Then call draw to update .
I want to get multiple scatter plots with the following conditions :
As you can see , the legend for the blue plot is overdrawn by the red plot .
And in a similar manner , you can shrink the plot vertically , and put the a horizontal legend at the bottom : #CODE
I would guess that thrope's solution does draw rectangles like this ( with the ` nearest ` neighbor option ) , but directly through Matplotlib .
More oddly , the above code with the subplot will show the image if I interact with the figure , such as by using the zoom tool and clicking randomly in the figure window ( there is no visible axes object , but I just click somewhere in the middle of the figure window ) .
When trying to save any of the figures created with ` transform =p rojection ` , ` cartopy._crs.CRS.transform_points ` raises the ` IndexError ` .
If I'm understanding you correctly , you should just be able to pick a single point on the right hand edge of the graph where the axes should be aligned , and matplotlib will take it from there .
You can draw the arrowhead midway along the arrow , like is done for a streamline .
If stuff like ` caretdown ` doesn't work for you , you can create your own marker by passing a list of ( x , y ) pairs , which are passed to a Path artist .

Axis bug on Pandas groupby boxplots
edit : if I want to plot each point separately so it can have a separate legend , how can I do it ?
What you need to do is tell the ` PatchCollection ` to match the original patches .
Then , the autoscale ` ylim ` are ` 10**0 ` to ` 10**1 ` though the data are only in the top portion of the plot .

Permanently registering colormaps in matplotlib
Perhaps I should add that I join the labels dynamically in the plot command using ` label=str ( pr_auc_values [ result_id ]) + ' | ' + filenames [ result_id ]` .
This rotates the ticklabels 30 degrees and right aligns them ( same result as when using ` autofmt_xdate `) for the bottom right subplot , leaving the two other subplots unchanged .

You just need to use ` twinx ` / ` twiny ` twice to get two independent axes ( there are probably ways to do this with out making a un-used middle axes , but this takes care a bunch of the behind-the-scenes details for you ): #CODE
What is more , the issue is limited to the interactive display : if I add a few more lines to ` animator ` to save the animation in mp4 format , the mp4 file is saved correctly even from Canopy .
The whole concept of a scatter plot is given by the non-diagonal elements of Example .
The solution is to transform the text rotation angle from the plot to the screen coordinate system , and let's see if resizing the plot causes issues as you suggest : #CODE

other solutions like : Python : 3D scatter losing colormap , assume continous Z ( X , Y ) functions , but what I have is a discontinious function .
It will be a vector graphic ( contours are collections of polygons ) .
Without the use of plt.tight_layout() , the overlap of the subplot axes is also worse .
By adding the dictonary keys to xticks and the values to bar and by measuring the length of D I was able to get each word for each x axis bar .
Then , in the second subplot , add the arguments ` sharex = ax1 ` and ` sharey = ax1 ` to the subplot command .

( I cannot post the image because I have not enough reputation , but basically it is a boxplot with Q1 at y=1 , Q3 at y=5 , and the outlier at y=10 )
This code is a bit of a mess , I am unclear why you are monkey patching the object returned by ` contour ` , you should not have to set ` im.axes ` , and you should use ` ax.contour ` .
The key is using the three parameter form of subplot : #CODE

Now when I try charts using ` ax1 ` and ` ax2 ` ( e.g. a Stock Price chart using ` ax1 ` and its Volume chart using ` ax2 `) and when I try to pan it , the ` ax1 ` charts don't move up-and-down , but the ` ax2 ` chart does .
You can define the axes first , create your plot using the keyword ` ax ` and set the ticks and tick labels manually using ` ax.set_xticks() ` ( #URL ): #CODE
If you change the third entry in the legend that starts with r ' to something like " asdf " and then comment out the rc line above plt.ylim that should remove everything that uses LaTeX and it might work .
Below I draw what I suppose to be the correct shape - I hope , I'm not wrong here ...
Regarding to the post Embedding small plots inside subplots in matplotlib , I'm working on this solution , but for some reason , transform is ignored !
I'm trying to plot a contour with unevenly spaced data in python using numpy , matplotlib plyplot and scipy .
I can use a pick event to pull off and re-plot the data in any one of the subplot .
Edit : Added legend and fill_between ( maybe there is better way to do this ) .
Thanks a lot , I just remove plt.show() and put it after all calls to the draw function .
A scatter plot will give what you describe .
Perhaps the issue is that ` ArtistAnimation ` expects a matplotlib artist and not a nx object ?
This means that you generate a new subplot every time you hit that line ( in your case , 50 times ) .

In that case , you'll make a new transform instance that does nothing : the ` IdentityTransform ` .
The most promising solution involves implementing a Locator ( based on MaxNLocator in this case ) to override MaxNLocator.view_limits .
The update_figure method might look like this ( you have to call draw to explicitly trigger a repaint ): #CODE
( any thoughts on this ? :)) Each subplot has the same style function .
Maybe you should look at the definition of hist .
I didn't play with it long enough to figure out how to force the legend to pick up the defined colors , but I'm sure you can do it .
@USER - In that case , you'd want to iterate over ` axes.flat ` , as ` axes ` will be a 2D array .

I'm trying to combine a normal matplotlib.pyplot ` plt.plot ( x , y )` with variable ` y ` as a function of variable ` x ` with a boxplot .
If I have to be there to restart after every animation , then I may as well stick with what I had .
If you want a title for each subplot , you can just use the title command for that axis .
If you're wanting to adjust vertical alignment , horizontal alignment , etc , just add those as arguments to ` annotate ` ( e.g. ` horizontalalignment= ' right '` or equivalently ` ha= ' right '`)
This answer is for anyone trying to change all the fonts , including for the legend , and for anyone trying to use different fonts and sizes for each thing .
Then the new subplot overlaps with the fourth one , when I want it positioned below obviously .
It's also _very_ slow to draw even a single plane , so I suspect that an OpenGL backend is the way to go , a la visvis .
It seems that is adding more complexity and having the undesired result of altering your legend location for you .
This code finds this axis and simply uses ax.plot() to draw the line .
My knowledge on the inner workings of matplotlib is limited , and some things I've tried is putting close() , clf() , and gc.collect() in animation ( i ) , but none of them worked .
When no axes limits are specified , matplotlib chooses default values as nice , round numbers below and above the minimum and maximum values in the list to be plotted .
Instead call ` plt.hist ` once , then manipulate the existing ` matplotlib.patches.Rectangle ` s in ` patches ` to update the histogram , and call
If you want separate colors for each point , you could use ` scatter ` : #CODE
