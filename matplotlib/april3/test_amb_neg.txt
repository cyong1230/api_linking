Drawing Arrow in ( x , y ) coordinate in Python
To be more specific , if you look at the answer to that question it shows how to make a 3D Arrow and use that to annotate points in a 3D plot -- I have used this recipe extensively and it makes me wonder how it isn't built into matplotlib yet .

However , the sample consists of distinct solutions which form lines in the parameter space such that putting everything into a matrix and using ` imshow ` is not desirable because of the pixelation artefacts ( Figure 1 ) .
See Figure 2 .
Labeling Figure from String List
I was able to maximize Figure windows for TkAgg , QT4Agg , and wxAgg using the following lines : #CODE
I want to draw a quadratic Figure .
So I guess I have to built each button separately , and don't know how to " order " them in the buttons_frame 2 ) I am working within a for loop , so I can't use a " main " specifically for this . and 3 ) the Figure to plot is already created before entering the GUI .
But I wonder if there is a way to do the same link ( when zooming on figure 1 , I get the same zoom on figure 2 on one particular axis ) when defining 2 different Figures ( I want those graph to appear far from each other so I guess that I can't put them in the same Figure ... )
I removed the reference to Figure 0 and had it generate a new figure each time .
Right now , that it the best I can do , see Figure .
Sounds like you just want an image in the Figure , right ?
You should perhaps try some converter that can produce DXF from EPS , PDF , SVG ...
For example see this converter in java :
You already have one such converter in your ` np.loadtxt ` method call .
You can achieve this by defining a converter that converts sting representations of dates to ` datenums ` .

Tick labels on x-axis aren't symmetric ( Matplotlib )
Tick label displayed when clicking on graph ?
Axes missing when plotting in matplotlib using vispy as backend
In theory , this code doesn't change any coordinates ; it just gets the coordinates of each label , maps it to Axes coordinates using the Text object's internally-stored transform , and then sets the position .
@USER I think he wants to get the tick positions in Axes coordinates .
Axes fonts with text.usetex ' true ' does not use set font
Also , when specifying where you want the subplot to be placed ( the third input to ` Figure.add_subplot() `) , you do not want to use ` y+1 ` because that would start at ` 1 ` and end at ` 6 ` which would go out of the available range of 0-5 .
While it might be possible to hack ` JointGrid ` to get this to work , I suspect it will very likely be easier to just use ` kdeplot ` on one Axes , using ` twinx ` and ` twiny to place and scale the marginal plots properly .
I want to transform those intensity values to pixel intensity values as in the following image :
The longer the time period becomes , the sharper the peaks will become ( the Fourier transform of the cosines ): #CODE
How to transform your data into this format is a simple question , maybe a bit googling and trial and error .
Perhaps it is best to transform to linear coordinates and calculate how to produce the curved grid for the declination and the radial lines for the right ascension .
Since my data is roughly spherical I triangulate the azimuth and zenith angles from the spherical coordinate transform of my data points .
A workaround might be to log10 transform the data before plotting , but the approaches I have tried , #CODE
Without having to transform everything to string or another kind of object ?
However , the dates mysteriously transform themselves to an ugly and unreadable format when plotting the same data as a bar plot .
I want to find out how to transform magnitude value of accelerometer to frequency domain .
Then , you need to set the transform for the new lines on ` a_all ` to move them to the new axis .

The second option is a touch more verbose , but has the advantage that the y-axis limits on the second plot will autoscale as you'd expect .
I included the code to autoscale the viewport , but that's not strictly necessary .
possible duplicate of [ How to autoscale y axis in matplotlib ? ] ( #URL )
if the image is a NxM array of any type , it is interpreted through the colormap ( autoscale , if not indicated otherwise ) .
Now I changed my mind and decide to autoscale the data ( and the view ) , expecting these limits :
I would like to be able to autoscale a matplotlib figure to make arbitrarily placed text annotations visible .
I have to refresh the page to get the tooltips back .
will refresh your system's reference to the bash_profile and you should be good to go in importing and using matplotlib
Id like the user to be able to update an existing and open axis i.e. to refresh the axis .
Placing Custom Images in a Plot Window -- as custom data markers or to annotate those markers
How to annotate / highlight a 3d plot in MatPlotLib
Well , it takes a loop to annotate all data points , I thought that there should be a function that does just that .
You can annotate a specific point in the image using ` plt.text ( x , y , str )` .
To state it in a general form , I'm looking for a way to join several points with a gradient color line using matplotlib , and I'm not finding it anywhere .
Now instead of straight arrows , I want to join points by curve arrows .
If you like , join circos's google group to discuss : #URL
Then join me in upvoting that answer and that comment :-)
Because there have been closest points but when we join them they lead to an intersections or points which are not so close but should be joined together
@USER Because Python automatically join two adjacent strings into one string .
This produces a figure like the first figure at How to join overlapping circles ?
Matplotlib has lots of pre-defined colormaps for you to use .
Here are all of the predefined colormaps .
For me the simplest way is plotting directly the masks with imshow , passing different colormaps .
There is a list of colormaps to choose from here .
There is also a way to define custom colormaps .
The list of available colormaps by default is here .
You can add your own colormaps to ` _cm.py ` in your mpl directory and then change your rc file .

If the ticklabels are already set to a string as in e.g. a boxplot , this is still working .
How do I add inset axes and zoom in on the first boxplot of the two ?
