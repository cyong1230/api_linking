python : get list from pandas dataframe column headers
I want to get a list of the column headers from a pandas dataframe .
The dataframe will come from user input so I won't know how many columns there will be or what they will be called .
For example , if I'm given a dataframe like this :
my_dataframe =
@CODE
I would want to get a list like this :
header_list =
@CODE
That's available as ` my_dataframe.columns ` .
You can get the values as a list by doing :
@CODE
@CODE
There is a built in method which is the most performant :
@CODE
` .columns ` returns an ` Index ` , ` .columns .values ` returns an ` array ` and this has a helper function to return a ` list ` .
EDIT
For those who hate typing this is probably the shortest method :
@CODE
@CODE
pandas docs : Iteration over dataframes return column labels
Did some quick tests , and perhaps unsurprisingly the built-in version using ` ` is the fastest :
@CODE
( I still really like the ` list ( dataframe )` though , so thanks EdChum ! )
Its gets even simpler ( by pandas 0.16.0 ) :
@CODE
will give you the column names in a nice list .
@CODE
