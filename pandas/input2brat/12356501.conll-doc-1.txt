Pandas : create two new columns in a dataframe with values calculated from a pre-existing column
I am working with the pandas library and I want to add two new columns to a dataframe ` df ` with n columns ( n > 0 ) .
These new columns result from the application of a function to one of the columns in the dataframe .
The function to apply is like :
@CODE
One method for creating a new column for a function returning only a value is :
@CODE
So , what I want , and tried unsuccesfully ( * ) , is something like :
@CODE
What the best way to accomplish this could be ?
I scanned the documentation with no clue .
* `df['column_A ' ] .map ( calculate )` returns a panda Series each item consisting of a tuple z , y .
And trying to assign this to two dataframe columns produces a ValueError .
I'd just use ` zip ` :
@CODE
