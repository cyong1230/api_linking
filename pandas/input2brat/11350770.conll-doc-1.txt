pandas + dataframe - select by partial string
I have a ` DataFrame ` with 4 columns of which 2 contain string values .
I was wondering if there was a way to select rows based on a partial string match against a particular column ?
In other words , a function or lambda function that would do something like
@CODE
returning a boolean .
I am familiar with the syntax of `df[df['A ' ] == " hello world " ] ` but can't seem to find a way to do the same with a partial string match say ' hello ' .
Would someone be able to point me in the right direction ?
Here's what I ended up doing for partial string matches .
If anyone has a more efficient way of doing this please let me know .
@CODE
Based on github issue #620 , it looks like you'll soon be able to do the following :
@CODE
Update : vectorized string methods ( i.e. , Series.str ) are available in pandas 0.8.1 and up .
Quick note : if you want to do selection based on a partial string contained in the index , try the following :
@CODE
I am using pandas 0.14.1 on macos in ipython notebook .
I tried the proposed line above :
@CODE
and got an error :
@CODE
but it worked perfectly when an " == True " condition was added , like this :
@CODE
Say you have the following ` DataFrame ` :
@CODE
You can always use the ` in ` operator in a lambda expression to create your filter .
@CODE
The trick here is to use the ` axis=1 ` option in the ` apply ` to pass elements to the lambda function row by row , as opposed to column by column .
