Converting Django QuerySet to pandas DataFrame
I am going to convert a Django QuerySet to a pandas DataFrame as follows :
@CODE
It works , but is there a more efficient way ?
From the Django perspective ( I'm not familiar with ` pandas `) this is fine .
My only concern is that if you have a very large number of records , you may run into memory problems .
If this were the case , something along the lines of this memory efficient queryset iterator would be necessary .
( The snippet as written might require some rewriting to allow for your smart use of ` .values() `) .
@CODE
The above is how I do the same thing .
The most useful addition is specifying which fields you are interested in .
If it's only a subset of the available fields you are interested in , then this would give a performance boost I imagine .
You maybe can use model_to_dict
@CODE
Django Pandas solves this rather neatly : https://github.com/chrisdev/django-pandas
From the README :
