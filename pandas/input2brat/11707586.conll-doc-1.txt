Python pandas , widen output display ?
Is there a way to widen the display of output in either interactive or script-execution mode ?
Specifically , I am using the describe() function on a Pandas dataframe .
When the dataframe is 5 columns ( labels ) wide , I get the descriptive statistics that I want .
However , if the dataframe has any more columns , the statistics are suppressed and something like this is returned :
@CODE
The " 8 " value is given whether there are 6 or 7 columns .
What does the " 8 " refer to ?
I have already tried dragging the IDLE window larger , as well as increasing the " Configure IDLE " width options , to no avail .
My purpose in using Pandas and describe() is to avoid using a second program like STATA to do basic data manipulation and investigation .
Thanks .

You can use ` print df.describe() .to_string() ` to force it to show the whole table .
( You can use ` to_string() ` like this for any DataFrame . The result of ` describe ` is just a DataFrame itself . )
The 8 is the number of rows in the DataFrame holding the " description " ( because ` describe ` computes 8 statistics , min , max , mean , etc . ) .
You can adjust pandas print options with ` set_printoptions ` .
@CODE
However this will not work in all cases as pandas detects your console width and it will only use ` to_string ` if the output fits in the console ( see the docstring of ` set_printoptions `) .
In this case you can explicitly call ` to_string ` as answered by BrenBarn .
Update
With version 0.10 the way wide dataframes are printed changed :
@CODE
Further more the API for setting pandas options changed :
@CODE
As @bmu mentioned , pandas auto detects ( by default ) the size of the display area , a summary view will be used when an object repr does not fit on the display .
You mentioned resizing the IDLE window , to no effect .
If you do ` print df.describe() .to_string() ` does it fit on the IDLE window ?
The terminal size is determined by ` pandas.util.terminal.get_terminal_size() ` , this returns a tuple containing the ` ( width , height )` of the display .
Does the output match the size of your IDLE window ?
There might be an issue ( there was one before when running a terminal in emacs ) .
Note that it is possible to bypass the autodetect , ` pandas.set_printoptions ( max_rows=200 , max_columns=10 )` will never switch to summary view if number of rows , columns does not exceed the given limits .
Update : Pandas 0.11.0 onwards
` pandas.set_printoptions ( ... )` is depracted .
Instead , use ` pandas.set_option ` .
Like :
@CODE
Here is the help :
@CODE
Try this :
@CODE
From the documentation :
display.expand_frame_repr : boolean
Whether to print out the full DataFrame repr for wide DataFrames across multiple lines , max_columns is still respected , but the output will wrap-around across multiple pages if it s width exceeds display.width .
[ default : True ] [ currently : True ]
See : http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html
You can set the output display to match your current terminal width :
@CODE
