Combining two Series into a DataFrame in pandas
I have two Series s1 and s2 with the same ( non-consecutive ) indices .
How do I combine s1 and s2 to being two columns in a DataFrame and keep one of the indices as a third column ?
Example code :
@CODE
Pandas allows you to create a ` DataFrame ` from a ` dict ` with ` Series ` as the values and the column names as the keys .
When it finds a ` Series ` as a value , it uses the ` Series ` index as part of the ` DataFrame ` index .
This data alignment is one of the main perks of Pandas .
Consequently , unless you have other needs , the freshly created ` DataFrame ` has duplicated value .
In the above example , `data['idx_col ' ] ` has the same data as ` data.index ` .
not sure I fully understand your question , but is this what you want to do ?
@CODE
( index= s1.index is not even necessary here )
Pandas will automatically align these passed in series and create the joint index
They happen to be the same here .
` reset_index ` moves the index to a column .
@CODE
I think ` concat ` is a nice way to do this .
If they are present it uses the name attributes of the Series as the columns ( otherwise it simply numbers them ):
@CODE
Note : This extends to more than 2 Series .
