How to drop rows of Pandas dataframe whose value of certain column is NaN
I have a df : @CODE
Then I just want the records whose EPS is not NaN, that is, df.drop(....) will return the dataframe as below: @CODE
How to do that ?
Don't `drop`. Just take rows where `EPS` is finite : @CODE
This question is already resolved, but... 
...also consider the solution suggested by Wouter in his original comment . The ability to handle missing data, including `dropna()`, is built into pandas explicitly. Aside from potentially improved performance over doing it manually, these functions also come with a variety of options which may be useful. @CODE
There are also other options (See docs at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html ), including dropping columns instead of rows. 
Pretty handy!
I know this has already been answered, but just for the sake of a purely pandas solution to this specific question as opposed to the general description from Aman (which was wonderful) and in case anyone else happens upon this: @CODE
