Pandas: Sampling a DataFrame
I'm trying to read a fairly large CSV file with Pandas and split it up into two random chunks, one of which being 10% of the data and the other being 90%. 
Here's my current attempt: @CODE
For some reason, `sklearn` throws this error when I try to use one of these resulting DataFrame objects inside of a SVM classifier: @CODE
I think I'm doing it wrong. Is there a better way to do this?
What version of pandas are you using? For me your code works fine (i`m on git master). 
Another approach could be: @CODE
Newer version (from 0.16.1 on) supports this directly: 
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html
I have found that `np.random.choice()` new in NumPy 1.7.0 works quite well for this. 
For example you can pass the index values from a DataFrame and and the integer 10 to select 10 random uniformly sampled rows. @CODE
If you're using pandas.read_csv you can directly sample when loading the data, by using the skiprows parameter. Here is a short article I've written on this - https://nikolaygrozev.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/fast-and-simple-sampling-in-pandas-when-loading-data-from-files/
Pandas 0.16.1 have a sample method for that.
