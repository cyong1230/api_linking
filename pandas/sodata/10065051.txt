python-pandas and databases like mysql
The documentation for Pandas has numerous examples of best practices for working with data stored in various formats. 
However, I am unable to find any good examples for working with databases like MySQL for example. 
Can anyone point me to links or give some code snippets of how to convert query results using mysql-python to data frames in Panda efficiently ?
As Wes says, io/sql's read_sql will do it, once you've gotten a database connection using a DBI compatible library. Here's a short example using the MySQLdb and cx_Oracle libraries to connect to Oracle and MySQL and query their data dictionaries: 
@CODE
The same syntax works for Ms SQL server using podbc also. 
@CODE
For Sybase the following works (with http://python-sybase.sourceforge.net ) 
@CODE
For the record, here is an example using a sqlite database: 
@CODE
And this is how you connect to PostgreSQL using psycopg2 driver (install with "apt-get install python-psycopg2" if you're on Debian Linux derivative OS). 
@CODE
MySQL example: 
@CODE
I prefer to create queries with SQLAlchemy , and then make a DataFrame from it. SQLAlchemy makes it easier to combine SQL conditions Pythonically if you intend to mix and match things over and over. 
@CODE
For recent readers of this question: pandas have the following warning in their docs for version 14.0 : 
Warning: Some of the existing functions or function aliases have been
deprecated and will be removed in future versions. This includes:
tquery, uquery, read_frame, frame_query, write_frame. 
And: 
Warning: The support for the mysql flavor when using DBAPI connection objects has
been deprecated. MySQL will be further supported with SQLAlchemy
engines (GH6900). 
This makes many of the answers here outdated. You should use `sqlalchemy`: 
@CODE
pandas.io.sql frame_query is deprecated. Use pandas.io.sql.read_sql instead.
