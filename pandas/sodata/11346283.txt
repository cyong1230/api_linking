Title:
Renaming columns in pandas
Q:
I have a data table using pandas and column labels that I need to edit to replace the original column labels. 
I'd like to change the column names in a data table `A` where the original column names are: 
@CODE@
to 
@CODE@
I have the edited column names stored it in a list, but I don't know how to replace the column names.
A1:
Just assign it to the `.columns` attribute: 
@CODE@
A2:
@CODE@
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.rename.html
A3:
The `rename` method can take a function, for example: 
@CODE@
A4:
Since you only want to remove the $ sign in all column names, you could just do: 
@CODE@
OR 
@CODE@
A5:
@CODE@
This way you can manually edit the `new_names` as you wish.Works great when you need to rename only a few columns to correct mispellings, accents, remove special characters etc.
A6:
As documented in http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/text.html : 
@CODE@
