How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame?
I have a DataFrames from pandas: 
@CODE
Output: 
@CODE
Now I want to iterate over the rows of the above frame. For every row I want to be able to access its elements (values in cells) by the name of the columns. So, for example, I would like to have something like that: 
@CODE
Is it possible to do that in pandas? 
I found similar question . But it does not give me the answer I need. For example, it is suggested there to use: 
@CODE
or 
@CODE
But I do not understand what the `row` object is and how I can work with it.
iterrows is a generator which yield both index and row 
@CODE
You can also use `df.apply()` to iterate over rows and access multiple columns for a function. 
docs: DataFrame.apply() 
@CODE
