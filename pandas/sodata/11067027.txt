Python Pandas - Re-ordering columns in a dataframe based on column name
I have a dataframe with over 200 columns(don't ask why). The issue is as they were generated the order is
['Q1.3','Q6.1','Q1.2','Q1.1',......] 
I need to re-order the columns as follows:
['Q1.1','Q1.2','Q1.3',.....'Q6.1',......] 
Is there someway for me to do this within python? 
Thanks!
@CODE
This assumes that sorting the column names will give the order you want. If your column names won't sort lexicographically (e.g., if you want column Q10.3 to appear after Q9.1), you'll need to sort differently, but that has nothing to do with pandas.
The `sort` method and `sorted` function allow you to provide a custom function to extract the key used for comparison: 
@CODE
You can also do more succinctly: 
`df.sort_index(axis=1)`
Tweet's answer can be passed to BrenBarn's answer above with

So for your example, say:

You get:

Then do:

resulting in:

You can just do:

Don't forget to add "inplace=True" to Wes' answer or set the result to a new DataFrame. 
@CODE
The quickest method is:

Be aware that this creates a new instance. Therefore you need to store the result in a new variable:
