Converting a Pandas GroupBy object to DataFrame
I'm starting with input data like this @CODE
Which when printed appears as this: @CODE
Grouping is simple enough: @CODE
and printing yields a GroupBy object: @CODE
But what I want eventually is another DataFrame object that contains all the rows in the GroupBy object. In other words I want to get the following result: @CODE
I can't quite see how to accomplish this in the pandas documentation. Any hints would be welcome.
`g1` here is a DataFrame. It has a hierarchical index, though: @CODE
Perhaps you want something like this? @CODE
Or something like: @CODE
generally you can do something like this: @CODE
Or: @CODE
