Title:
How to filter the DataFrame rows of pandas by "within"/"in"?
Q:
I have a DataFrame 'rpt' of Python pandas: 
@CODE@
I can filter the rows whose stock id is '600809' like this: `rpt[rpt['STK_ID']=='600809']` 
@CODE@
and I want to get all the rows of some stocks together, such as `['600809','600141','600329']`, that means I want a syntax like this: 
@CODE@
Since pandas not accept above command, how to achieve the target?
A1:
Use the `isin` method. `rpt[rpt['STK_ID'].isin(stk_list)]`.
A2:
you can also use ranges by using: 
@CODE@
A3:
`isin()` is ideal if you have a list of exact matches, but if you have a list of partial matches or substrings to look for, you can filter using the `str.contains` method and regular expressions. 
For example, if we want to return a DataFrame where all of the stock IDs which begin with `'600'` and then are followed by any three digits: 
@CODE@
Suppose now we have a list of strings which we want the values in `'STK_ID'` to end with, e.g. 
@CODE@
We can join these strings with the regex 'or' character `|` and pass the string to `str.contains` to filter the DataFrame: 
@CODE@
Finally, `contains` can ignore case (by setting `case=False`), allowing you to be more general when specifying the strings you want to match. 
For example, 
@CODE@
would match `PANDAS`, `PanDAs`, `paNdAs123`, and so on.
A4:
You can also directly query your DataFrame for this information.

Or similarly search for ranges:
