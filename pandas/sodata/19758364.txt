python: rename single column header in pandas dataframe
I've got a dataframe called data. How would I rename the only one column header? For example 'gdp' to 'log(gdp)'? @CODE
`data.rename(columns={'gdp':'log(gdp)'}, inplace=True)
` 
The `rename` show that it accepts a dict as a param for `columns` so you just pass a dict with a single entry.
