in Ipython notebook, Pandas is not displying the graph I try to plot.
I am trying to plot some data using pandas in Ipython Notebook, and while it gives me the object, it doesn't actually plot the graph itself. So it looks like this: @CODE
The graph should follow after that, but it simply doesn't appear. I have imported matplotlib, so that's not the problem. Is there any other module I need to import ?
With your `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` just add @CODE
and it will show all stored plots.
Ok, It seems the answer is to start ipython notebook with --pylab=inline. 
so ipython notebook --pylab=inline
This has it do what I saw earlier and what I wanted it to do. 
Sorry about the vague original question.
Note that --pylab is deprecated and has been removed from newer builds of IPython, so the accepted answer will no longer work. The recommended way to enable inline plotting in the IPython Notebook is now to run: @CODE
See this post from the ipython-dev mailing list for more details.
start ipython with `ipython notebook --pylab inline` ,then graph will show inline.
simple after importing the matplotlib you have execute one magic if you have started the ipython as like this @CODE
run this command everything will be shown perfectly
