how to get row count of pandas dataframe?
i try to get the number of rows of dataframe df, both code snippets give me an error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'instancemethod' and 'int' 
@CODE
I'd be grateful for any suggestions what I'm doing wrong. 
EDIT: According to the answer given by root the best (the fastest) way to check df length is to call: 
@CODE
You can use the `.shape` property or just `len(DataFrame.index)` as there are notable performance differences: 
@CODE
EDIT: As noted @Dan Allen in the comments `len(df.index)` and `df[0].count()` are not interchangeable as `count` excludes `NaN`s,
Use `len(df)`. This works as of pandas 0.11 or maybe even earlier. 
`__len__()` is currently (0.12) documented with `Returns length of index`. Timing info, set up the same way as in root's answer: 
@CODE
Due to one additional function call it is a bit slower than calling `len(df.index)` directly, but this should not play any role in most use cases.
