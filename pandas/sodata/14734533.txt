How to access pandas groupby dataframe by key
How do I access the corresponding groupby dataframe in a groupby object by the key? With the following groupby: 
@CODE
I can iterate through it to get the keys and groups: 
@CODE
I would like to be able to do something like 
@CODE
But when I do that (well, actually I have to do `gb[('foo',)]`), I get this weird `pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy` thing which doesn't seem to have any methods that correspond to the DataFrame I want. 
The best I can think of is 
@CODE
but this is kind of nasty, considering how nice pandas usually is at these things. 
What's the built-in way of doing this?
You can use the `get_group` method: 
@CODE
Wes McKinney (pandas' author) in Python for Data Analysis provides the following recipe: 
@CODE
which returns a dictionary whose keys are your group labels and whose values are DataFrames, i.e. 
@CODE
will yield what you are looking for: 
@CODE
Rather than 
@CODE
I prefer using `gb.groups` 
@CODE
Because in this way you can choose multiple columns as well. for example: 
@CODE
I was looking for a way to sample a few members of the GroupBy obj - had to address the posted question to get this done. 
create groupby object 
@CODE
pick N dataframes and grab their indicies 
@CODE
grab the groups 
@CODE
optionally - turn it all back into a single dataframe object 
@CODE
