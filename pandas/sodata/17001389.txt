pandas resample documentation
So I completely understand how to use resample , but the documentation does not do a good job explaining the options. 
So most options in the `resample` function are pretty straight forward except for these two: 
rule : the offset string or object representing target conversion 
how : string, method for down- or re-sampling, default to mean 
So from looking at as many examples as I found online I can see for rule you can do `'D'` for day, `'xMin'` for minutes, `'xL'` for milliseconds, but that is all I could find. 
for how I have seen the following: `'first'`, `np.max`, `'last'`, `'mean'`, and `'n1n2n3n4...nx'` where nx is the first letter of each column index. 
So is there somewhere in the documentation that I am missing that displays every option for `pandas.resample`'s rule and how inputs? If yes, where because I could not find it. If no, what are all the options for them?
@CODE
See the timeseries documentation . It includes a list of offsets (and 'anchored' offsets ), and a section about resampling . 
Note that there isn't a list of all the different `how` options, because it can be any NumPy array function and any function that is available via groupby dispatching can be passed to `how` by name.
There's more to it than this, but you're probably looking for this list:

A lot of the rules are based on scikits.timeseries library.
