Pandas GroupBy memory deallocation I noticed that memory allocated while iterating through a Pandas GroupBy object is not deallocated after iteration . I use resource.getrusage ( resource.RUSAGE_SELF ) .ru_maxrss ( second answer in this post for details ) to measure the total amount of active memory used by the Python process . prints the following total active memory ( in gb ) Uncommenting del idx , x and gc.collect() fixes the problem . I do however have to del all variables that reference the DataFrames returned by iterating over the groupby ( which can be a pain depending on the code in the inner for loop ) . The new printed memory usages become : Alternatively I can uncomment gb = list ( gb ) . The resulting memory usages are roughly the same as those from the previous solution : This is very interesting ! You do not need del idx , x . Only using gc.collect() worked to keep memory constant for me . This is much cleaner that having the del statements inside the loop .
